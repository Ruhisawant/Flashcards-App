## Notes

One of the main challenges in building the app was ensuring that the "Next" button selected a truly random card while preventing the same card from appearing consecutively. Additionally, maintaining the correct flipped state when switching between cards required careful handling to ensure that each new card started unflipped. Styling the cards dynamically based on their assigned colors while keeping the UI visually appealing also required fine-tuning to achieve a cohesive design.
